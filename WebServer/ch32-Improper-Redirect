WebServer Challenge 32 - Improper Redirect

Synopsis - Get Access to the Index

The point here is to abuse the way the application is redirecting.

By Making a direct HTTP request to:
http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch32/index.php 

When intercepting the request we get this message before the 302 ReDirect happens


<p>Yeah ! The redirection is OK, but without exit() after the header('Location: ...'), PHP just continue the execution and send the page content !...</p>

<p>The flag is : ExecutionAfterRedirectIsBad</p>
